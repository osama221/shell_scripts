##this script is intended to be one file only not more than that so the nginx configuratios are implemented in the same file.

first of all this script makes an nginx site with all the necessary configurations needed like:SSL, symbolic linking, adding paths, redirectiong to internal docker 
container, etc.
so this file all what u need to do is to put the name of ur company and will do the rest but u need first to specify the subdomain, DNS and IP to set up the ssl 
certificate.
